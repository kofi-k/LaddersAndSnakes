# Snakes :snake: and Ladders :ladder: Game 

## Snakes and ladders is java project.
It applies the 4 pillars of OOP to simulate the traditional ladders and snakes game. _It is purely codes_

## Some features implemented in the game
- rolling a 6 before starting at square 1
- rolling again if a 6 is rolled and again if its another 6 and again ...and you know what I mean. Extra dice on rolling a 6
- and yes the snakes bite but they are corrupt if you give them biscuits
- of course the ladder takes you to top square 
- guess what! you get to kick out your opponents. Isn't that mean and vicious and cool?
- and uhmm you'd need to roll the exact dice for the number of squares remaining to win the game....does this make any sense to you?
- annnnddd I'm yawning 
- for the record this isn't a nice looking code but it **WORKS!** ...don't you give me that look on your face

### **FORK** this already, get your hands dirty and send that pull request with some happy looking upgrades
