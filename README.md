# Snakes :snake: and Ladders :ladder: Game 
Ladders and Snakes is java coded from scratch to simulate the traditional  ladders and snakes game. 
It literally implements majority of the rules of the game
-from rolling a 6 before starting at square 1
-rolling again if a 6 is rolled and again if its another 6 and again ...and you know what I mean. Extra dice on rolling a 6
-and yes the snakes bite but they are corrupt if you give them biscuits
-of course the ladder takes you to the top 
-guess what! you get to kick out your opponents. Isn't that mean and great?
-and uhmm you'd need to roll the exact dice for the number of squares remaining to win the game....does this make any sense to you?
-annnnddd I'm yawning 
-for the record this isn't a nice looking code but it WORKS!..don't give me that look

FORK this, get your hands dirty and send that pull request with some happy looking upgrades
